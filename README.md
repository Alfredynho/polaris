# Polaris
Multi-purpose telegram bot written in Python. I made this for personal use so I won't provide any support or install instructions.

<b>THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND</b>

# TODO
* ~~Use JSON to store settings and data.~~
* ~~Implement locales.~~
* Change settings and locales without restarting.
* Move all plugin documentation to locales.

* Add group management stuff. (In progress)
